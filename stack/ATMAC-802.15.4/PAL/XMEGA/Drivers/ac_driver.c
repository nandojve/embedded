 * \brief  XMEGA Analog Comparator driver source file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function implementations for the XMEGA Analog Comparator driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead would decrease code performance. The driver is intended for
 *      rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for getting started with
 *      the XMEGA Analog Comparator.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 *      Several functions use the following construct:
 *          "some_register = ... | (some_parameter ? SOME_BIT_bm : 0) | ..."
 *      Although the use of the ternary operator ( if ? then : else ) is discouraged,
 *      in some occasions the operator makes it possible to write pretty clean and
 *      neat code. In this driver, the construct is used to set or not set a
 *      configuration bit based on a boolean input parameter, such as
 *      the "some_parameter" in the example above.
 *
