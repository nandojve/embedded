 * \brief  XMEGA 32-bit RTC driver source file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function implementations the XMEGA 32-bit RTC
 *      driver.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead decreases code performance.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1010: Minimizing the power consumption of XMEGA devices
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
