/**
 *  \mainpage Standalone lwIP example
 *
 *  \section Purpose
 *  This documents data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 *  typedefs in the software for the lwIP standalone example.
 *
 *  The given example is a lwIP example using the current lwIP stack and EMAC driver.
 *
 *  \section Requirements
 *
 *  This package can be used with SAM3X-EK and SAM4E-EK.
 *
 *  \section Description
 *
 *  This example features simple lwIP web server.
 *  - Plug the Ethernet cable directly into the evaluation kit to connect to the PC.
 *  - Configuring the PC network port to local mode to setup a 'point to point' network.
 *  - Start the example.
 *  - Launch your favorite web browser.
 *  - Type the WEB server example IP address in your browser's address bar.
 *
 *  \section Usage
 *
 *  -# Build the program and download it into the evaluation board. Please
 *     refer to the
 *     <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/6421B.pdf">
 *     SAM-BA User Guide</a>, the
 *     <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc6310.pdf">
 *     GNU-Based Software Development</a>
 *     application note or the
 *     <a href="http://www.iar.com/website1/1.0.1.0/78/1/">
 *     IAR EWARM User and reference guides</a>,
 *     depending on the solutions that users choose.
 *  -# On the computer, open and configure a terminal application
 *     (e.g., HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 *    - 115200 bauds
 *    - 8 bits of data
 *    - No parity
 *    - 1 stop bit
 *    - No flow control
 *  -# In the terminal window, the
 *     following text should appear (values depend on the board and the chip used):
 *     \code
 *      LwIP: DHCP StartedNetwork upIP=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 *     \endcode
 *  -# The application will output converted value to hyperterminal and display
 *     a menu for users to set different modes.
